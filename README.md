EUCLES:
As a child, he was kidnapped. Meanwhile, a cult had summoned a higher being who destroyed the village, saving him in the progress. He had looked up to the being ever since, devoting his whole life to summoning it. His parents passed away during the fire and he was raised by his elder sister. Due to his obsession with a creature seen as evil, he was often ostracized as a child. Eventually, his sister was blamed for his actions and sent away to another village.
